# renderhub

renderhub is a serverless web application that provides automated HTML-to-PDF rendering with secure file access and management. The system is designed as a multi-layered platform consisting of a React-based frontend, a backend API, asynchronous processing pipelines, and persistent storage components.

The application implements a fully serverless and event-driven architecture leveraging AWS services such as Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, RDS, and S3. Users can authenticate, submit HTML conversion requests, retrieve generated PDFs, and manage stored files through a streamlined interface and REST API.
